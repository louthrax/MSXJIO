# MSXJIO


## Overview

**MSXJIO** is a project that allows serving a hard or floppy disk-image (and other things to come),
 from a host computer (or smartphone) to your MSX, through high-speed **115200 bauds** communication on joystick port 2.

 All you need is a cheap USB or Bluetooth communication chip, and a 16KB or 32KB ROM (for the MSX-DOS clients).

**JIO** stands for **J**oystick **I**nput **O**utput.

The system is divided into two parts:

- **JIOServer**: the server application, which runs on **Linux**, **Windows**, **macOS**, or **Android**.

- **MSX Clients**:
    - **JIO MSX-DOS 1**  
    A modified version of MSX-DOS 1 reading sectors from a served hard or floppy disk image

    - **JIO MSX-DOS 2**  
    A modified and compact version of MSX-DOS 2 reading sectors from a served hard or floppy disk image

    - **JSYNC** (not released yet)  
    An MSX-DOS 2 tool to synchronize files an directories between MSX and host (a bit like rsync).

    - **JRTC** (not released yet)  
    An MSX-DOS 2 tool to synchronize MSX RTC time and date with host.

There's also a **JSM** (JIO Serial Monitor) helper tool that you can use to configure your Bluetooth communication chip.

## Download
All server (Android, Linux, Windows and macOS) and client software can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/louthrax/MSXJIO/releases).

## Supported MSX models

As the signal decoding is done in a software way on MSX, the client MSX Z80 frequency needs to be as
close as possible from the "standard" one (3 579 545 Hz):  
- Models confirmed to be working:  

    | Model           | Frequency     |
    |----------------|----------------| 
    | VG-8235        | 3 554 367 Hz   |
    | NMS 8255       | Not measured   |
    | VG-8010        | Not measured   |
    | VG-8020        | 3 579 200 Hz   |
    | HB-G900AP      | 3 578 959 Hz   |
    | HB-F700F       | 3 579 599 Hz   |
    | Toshiba HX-10  | 3 579 367 Hz   |
    | Palcom PX-V60  | 3 579 431 Hz   |
    | turboR         | 3 579 617 Hz   |


- Models tested as non-working:

    | Model          | Frequency     |
    |----------------|---------------| 
    |National CF-3000|3 579 405 Hz   |
    |Casio PV-7      |3 579 431 Hz   |

Weirdly, the frequency of these models is close from the standard one, but there might be other
(electronical) factors here...

## Harware

JIOServer can communicate with the MSX through:

- **USB**, using a **USB to TTL UART Converter**

  <p align="center">
    <img src="./readme_resources/USB_to_TTL-UART_Converter.jpg" width="200"/>
  </p>

  Models confirmed to be working are:
  
    - FTDI USB UART IC FT232RL

---

- **Bluetooth**, using a **Bluetooth Serial Transceiver Module**  
    <p align="center">
      <img src="./readme_resources/Bluetooth_Serial_Transceiver_Module.jpg" width="200"/>
    </p>  
    Models confirmed to be working are:

    - HC-05
    - HC-06

---

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT use standard RS-232 adapters**‚Äîthey may output +12V/-12V, which can **damage your MSX**.

For both USB and Bluetooth, prefer the 5V versions, as the standard voltage on the MSX joystick port is 5V. Some models have jumpers to switch between different voltages (5V or 3.3V).

## Building the adapter Cable

- MSX Joystick Port 2, Pin 1 ‚Üí Adapter **TX**  
- MSX Joystick Port 2, Pin 6 ‚Üí Adapter **RX**  
- MSX Joystick Port 2, Pin 9 ‚Üí Adapter **GND**  
- MSX Joystick Port 2, Pin 5 ‚Üí Adapter **VCC**, ‚ö†Ô∏è only required for Bluetooth

## Usage Instructions for the MSX-DOS clients

1. Create an MSX-DOS 2 cartridge (or flash `JIO-MSXDOS2` to a MegaFlashROM or Carnivore2).
1. Connect your MSX to your PC using a USB serial cable or Bluetooth adapter.
1. Launch **JIOServer** and select the disk image to serve.
1. Select USB or Bluetooth mode using the <img src="./server/icons/Bluetooth.svg" width="20"/> or  <img src="./server/icons/USB.svg" width="20"/> button
1. Select the communication device to use (ttyUSB0 or DSD TECH HC-05 for example)
1. Click the <img src="./server/icons/disconnected.svg" width="20"/> button.
1. Boot your MSX.
1. You should see an <span style="color:green">Info‚úì </span> appear in the server log and the LED blink.
1. The MSX should now access the image.

*Instructions to be added.*


## Bluetooth Configuration for MSXJIO

1. Default password: `1234`
1. Plug the **HC-05** into the **Bluetooth** socket.
1. Plug the **FTDI FT232RL** into the **USB Cable** socket.
1. Hold the **AT** button on the HC-05.
1. While holding, plug the USB into your PC.
1. The HC-05 LED should blink **slowly** (~2s).
1. Launch the **DSD TECH Wireless Tools** utility.
1. Set UART port to e.g. `COM9`, Baud Rate to `38400`, and click **Open`.
1. You should now be able to send AT commands.
1. Configure for this project by sending:  
    `AT+UART=115200,1,0`

## History

This project began with **NYYRIKKI**‚Äôs brilliant 115200 bps MSX serial communication routine:  
üëâ https://www.msx.org/forum/msx-talk/development/software-rs-232-115200bps-on-msx

Shortly after, he released a working **MSX-DOS 1** version serving disk images with **drive sound emulation**:  
üëâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHs5a-gZtuc

At the same time, I was aware of **b3rendsh**‚Äôs MSX-DOS 2 project:  
üëâ https://github.com/b3rendsh/msxdos2s  
It was a natural fit to integrate NYYRIKKI‚Äôs fast communication routines to support full disk image serving.

NYYRIKKI‚Äôs original server code was functional but command-line only. I contacted b3rendsh, and he kindly joined the project. After several months of collaborative coding and debugging, we finally reached a stable and usable version.
